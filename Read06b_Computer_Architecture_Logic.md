### How Computers Work
#### What makes a computer a computer?
##### All Computers do these 4 things
  - Take input
    - Key strokes, gestures, mouse movement
  - Store information
    - Input stored in memory
  - Process that information
    - Processor takes information from memory
    - Processor send info back to memory
    - Process is repeated until information is ready for output
  - Process that information
  - Deliver the results
    - Display text, videos, signals to robots

##### Data & Binary
- Binary, the 1s and 0s that TV hackers mash into a notepad are mostly used in the background
  - BInary can only count two (bi) digits, one and zero
  - Binary number system progresses in multiples of 2 per additional number
  - 1001 has a value of 9=(1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1)
  - Thusly all numbers can be represented with binary given enough wires are available
  - Text, images, sound all have binary value
- Wires and circuits carry information throughout the computer
  - Each wire has binary decisions based on wether or not it receives a signal, called a "bit"
  - Many wires designed to answer a different binary question can eventually work together to solve complex questions

##### Circuits & Logic
- Computer inputs and outputs are all types of information represented through binary (on/off)
- Millions of electrical components carrying input/output come together to create circuits
- circuits can alter the 1s or 0s that enter them by switching them or combining them. 
- Each simple circuit adds to the immense complexity of the whole computer
- Smaller computers are faster because the electrical signal has less distance to travel

##### CPU, Memory, Ins and Outs
Input
- keyboards, microphone, sensors, camera, etc.
- Keyboard convers letter to binary and sends the info to the CPU
- Memory reminds the CPU what that binary number represents so it can decode that information 
- CPU sends that decoded information back to memory which then sends it to the output device and displays the proper letter on the monitor
Output
- Screens, speakers, printers, car engine
- As demands for higher fidelity output increases, so increases the need for more powerful components to properly deliver that output
  - Multiple CPUs and additional memory

  ##### Hardware & Software
Hardware
- Physical components of the computer. Wires, circuits, etc.
- CPU is the brain of the computer that controls all other parts.
  - Constructed of many smaller parts that each handle different, specific tasks so it can multitask.
  - All action taken by the CPU reflected through the input and output of binary
  - Binary commands stored in memory which the CPU fetches when needed and returns when it doesn't.

Software
- Code, apps, games, website
- Software is essentially all binary, though it is never written in it
  - Programming languages like html,fortran, python, etc. grant people the ability to communicate far more effectively with the binary language of the computer, effectively serving as a translator
  - Software tells the CPU what to do. 
- Operating System is the master program that manages software interaction with hardware
  - Other software is subsidiary to the OS
