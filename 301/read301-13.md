# Sending Form Data

When a user submits a form they in effect are making a request to a server using HTTP protocol that responds to the users request with the same protocol. The HTML element `<form>` is what defines how the data is sent, and that how can be maniuplated with it's attributes. 

The `action=""` attribute defines where the data will be sent, and must include an absolute or relative URL. Absolute URLs being web address of a website, Relative URLs being a pathway within the same website.

```HTML
<!-- Absolute URL -->
<form action="https://example.com">
<!-- Relative URL -->
<form action="/somewhere_else">
```

The `action` value is recommended to be it's own file on the server which handles the receiving of the form data and the response.

The `method=""` attribute defines how the data is sent, usually as a `GET` or a `POST` method. In simplest terms, `POST` creates and `GET` reads. Not as simply, `GET` asks the server for a resource that already exists, objects from constructors, images, etc. Things that you would have hard-coded into your server to be accessed upon user request. `POST` takes a close look at the data that the user sends, built into the HTTP request, and responds with data tailored to the parameters the user sends in their request.
