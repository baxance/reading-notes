# CSS Grid

A 2d layout system to surpass the 1d Flexbox. Similarly to flexbox you apply CSS rules to both the parent which becomes the Grid Container as well as the children of the element which becokme Grid Items. The Grid is a layout system designed specifically to circumvent the hack-y nature of floats and blocks and positioning for a simpler and more powerful tool purpose-built to solve long standing layout issues.

The `grid container` must first be identified, and it's columns and rows in their numbers and size set.

```CSS
section {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 20%)   /* the repeat function here creates 5 columns with equal width of 20% of the total container width */
  grid-template-rows: 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% /* a really slow and repetitive way to do the above, but if each row is going to be a different size then you don't have much choice now do you?*/
}
```

This code block creates a 5x5 grid, ripe and ready for child elements to fill the sections of the grid.

```CSS
#header-picture {
  grid-column-start: 1; /*the element starts at the first vertical grid line, the leftmost border in this case*/
  grid-column-end: 6; /*the element ends at the 6the vertical grid line, which in the case of a 5x5 grid will be the rightmost border line*/
}

#sidebar{
  grid-row: 2 /5; /*the element will start on the second horizontal grid line and end on the 5th, */
}
```

Like in Flexbox (RIP in my mind 2/17-2/18 5ever in are harts) the order of the items being placed into the grid doesn't matter, the positioning being defined within the grid is what does. This makes it easy to go back into the CSS and reposition items.
