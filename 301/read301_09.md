# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

"Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data" — Wikipedia

Pure Functions are defined thusly

- the function returns the same result if given the same arguments
  
Impure function example from medium.com:

```JS
let PI = 3.14;
const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI;
calculateArea(10); // returns 314.0
```

Pure function examples:

```JS
let PI = 3.14;
const calculateArea = (radius, pi) => radius * radius * pi;
calculateArea(10, PI); // returns 314.0
```

The difference here is that the impure function receives a global object that was not passed into the function as a parameter, and the answer returned from the function is changed if a variable from outside of that functions scope is changed.

- Reading External files makes a function impure because the file's contents can be changed and what the function returns can change with it.
- RNG Any function that relies on RNGesus can never be saved and be allowed into the Kingdom of Pure Functions
- it does not cause observable side effects such as modifying a global object/variable.

Impure Function causing observable side effects

```JS
let counter = 1;
function increaseCounter(value) {
  counter = value + 1;
}
increaseCounter(counter);
console.log(counter); // 2
```

Pure Function solving the same problem by taking the counter variable as an argument and increasing it's value within the scope of the function without actually changing it's global value.

```JS
let counter = 1;
const increaseCounter = (value) => value + 1;
increaseCounter(counter); // 2
console.log(counter); // 1
```
