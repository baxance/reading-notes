# SQL Bolt

SQL does not require keywords be capitalized but convention dictates it in order for the keywords to be easily read and distinguised from the column/table names and values

Select query for a specific column(s):

```SQL
SELECT column_name, column_name2,
FROM table_name;
```

Select query for *all* columns with `*`

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```

Operator | Condition | SQL
----|-------|---------
=, !=, <, <=, >, >= | Numerical Operators | `column_name != 4`
BETWEEN ... AND .. | Number is between two ranges | `column_name BETWEEN 1 AND 5`
NOT BETWEEN ... AND ... | Number is not between two ranges | `column_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 5`
IN (...) | number/string exists in list | `column_name IN (1, 2 ,3)`
NOT IN  (..) | Number/string does not exist in a list | `column_name NOT IN (1, 2, 3)`
= | Case-sensitive exact string comparison | `column_name ="something"`
!= or <> | case-sensitive exact string inequality comparison | `column_name != "something"`
LIKE | case insensitive string comparison | `column_name LIKE "SoMeThInG"`
NOT LIKE | case insensitive string inequality comparison | `column_name NOT LIKE "SoMeThInG"`
% | used in string to match a sequence of zero or more characters with LIKE or NOT LIKE | `column_name LIKE "%AT%"` (will match itself and any word that contains that string like Attic, Bats, Cats)
_ | used in string to match a single character | `column_name LIKE "AN_"` (will match with AND but not itself)

Select query with unique results

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
```

Select query with ordered results

```SQL
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
```

Select query with limited rows

```SQL
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

Create table statement w/ optional table constraint and default value

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (
    column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    …
);
```
