# EJS Partials

Partials function much like functions, in that they're reusable and redeployable pieces of code, in this case HTML, that can be used across a website to make creating a larger website easier by not having to repeat code like headers, footers, or other elements that are otherwise going to be staying the same. Like other EJS files the files that contain the partials belong in the `views` and `/partials/` subfolder.

```JS
// in the views/partials/navbar.ejs folder
<div class="header clearfix">
    <nav>
        <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
            <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>
    </nav>
</div>
```

And then insert the `<%- include('partials/navbar') %>` ejs into the html to automatically polulate the contents of the ejs folder into the deployed html page.
