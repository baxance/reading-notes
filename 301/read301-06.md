# Node JS

*Node* or *Node.js* is an event-based Javascript runtime that uses Google's V8 Engine which is run in the Chrome and Chromium-based browsers like Brave, Opera and Vivaldi. In short it compiles JS into a "native machine code" that the computer can execute, but it is done locally, not through a browser.

When node is installed it comes with a package manager called *NPM* that holds over 1,00,000 packages of JavaScript code available for download. To install one of these packages *globally* the terminal command is `npm install -g nameOfPackage` to install a package *locally* navigate through your termical to the local directory you want the package installed in and enter the command `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file in the directory, then `npm install nameOfPackage` and optionall add `-- save` at the end of that command line to save the package as a project dependency. Within the directory you'll find a folder called `node_modules` where NPM will have stored any package downloaded as well as all of it's dependencies.
