# Linked Lists

A linked list is a series of nodes tied together like links in a chain, with each node referencing the next in line.

- Singly is the number of references a node has, and a singly-linked list has only one reference which points to the next node
- Doubly linked lists , as you might have guessed have double the references, one with the next node and one with the prior node as well
- Nodes, oft mentioned thus far, are the individual links in the chain and contain their data
- Next is a property of each node that refers to the next node in the link
- Head is a reference to the first node in a linked list
- Current is a reference to the node currently being looked at

Similar to arrays in concept, Linked Lists cannot be traversed through for/forEach loops, and must use a While loop while depending on the Next property defined above.

Sample Code

```Java
public static boolean includes(int value)

Current = Head // makes sure the loop starts at the beginning of the LL

while (Current != null) { //only runs if the current node has a value
  if (Current.value == value){ // checking if the value of current is the value we want. if it is, the loop ends and the method returns true
    return true
  }
  else (Current = Current.Next){ // if it is not the value we are looking for, the value of current is changed to look at the next link
  }
}
    return false // if the value never returns true then the value is not in the LL, therefore the method is false
```

Big O of time for the sample method is O(n), with n representing the nodes within the LL.
Big O of space would be O(1) because nothing is being created in the method, and the space taken up by the LL does not change.
