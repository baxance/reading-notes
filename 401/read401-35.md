# Graphs

Non linear data structure. Nodes are now *vertices* and connections are *edges*

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
1. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
1. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
1. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

Traversals are similar to tree traversal.

```java
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
```
