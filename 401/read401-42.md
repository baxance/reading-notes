# Location

Grants app ability to request the last known location of the device the app was run on.

Throw this in the onCreate of the activity that you want to trigger location services.

```java
private FusedLocationProviderClient fusedLocationClient;

// ..

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // ...

    fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(this);
}
```

Get last known location with this block. Accuracy of the location is determined by the permissions outlined in the app Manifest.

```java
fusedLocationClient.getLastLocation()
        .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<Location>() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(Location location) {
                // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
                if (location != null) {
                    // Logic to handle location object
                }
            }
        });
```
