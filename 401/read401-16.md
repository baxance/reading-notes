# Spring Authorization

Using GitHub for authentication.

```java
<dependency> //Dependency to add for OAuth 2.0
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Add a [github app](https://github.com/settings/developers) by selecting for a new app and then register a new app with a name a description and the app's home page, or the localhost the app is hosted on. Use `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/github` as the authorization callback url and register.

```java
spring:             // Add to application.yml
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          github:
            clientId: github-client-id       // replace with credentials from github
            clientSecret: github-client-secret        // replace with credentials from github
# ...
```

In launching the app homepage it should redirect to a github login.
