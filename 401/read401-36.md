# Cognito

Cognito is the security suite for amplify auth. the Amplify CLI is used to create and configure it.

`amplify add auth` to start provisioning the suit from the project directory

```CLI
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
```

answer the prompts thusly and `amplify push` to complete the process. Add dependenciy `implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.17.4'` to the `build.gradle`

Add the auth plugins

```java
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());
```

Plug the following into the `MainActiviy` `onCreate` Method.

```java
Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession(
    result -> Log.i("AmplifyQuickstart", result.toString()),
    error -> Log.e("AmplifyQuickstart", error.toString())
