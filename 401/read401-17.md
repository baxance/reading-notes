# Many-to-Many relationships

The `@ManyToMany` annotation is used to create a web of associations between databases. In the Baeldung Employee/Project example for instance it would allow the creation of relationships from multiple employees to multiple projects, and also multiple projects to individual employees. Naturally doing this would require both Employee and Project databases but also an Employee-Project database that handles the project(s) assigned to employee(s) with the foreign keys of both of their associated databases.

```sql
// big ol block of sql
CREATE TABLE `employee` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `first_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=17 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `project` (
  `project_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`project_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=18 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

CREATE TABLE `employee_project` (
  `employee_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `project_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`employee_id`,`project_id`),
  KEY `project_id` (`project_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employee_project_ibfk_1` 
   FOREIGN KEY (`employee_id`) REFERENCES `employee` (`employee_id`),
  CONSTRAINT `employee_project_ibfk_2` 
   FOREIGN KEY (`project_id`) REFERENCES `project` (`project_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

Both Employee and Project will need to be modeled and repositories created with JPA Annotation.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "Employee")
public class Employee { 
    // ...
 
    @ManyToMany(cascade = { CascadeType.ALL })
    @JoinTable(
        name = "Employee_Project", 
        joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "employee_id") }, 
        inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = "project_id") }
    )
    Set<Project> projects = new HashSet<>(); // refers to PROJECT CLASS BELOW
   
    // standard constructor/getters/setters
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

@Entity
@Table(name = "Project")
public class Project {    
    // ...  
 
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "projects")
    private Set<Employee> employees = new HashSet<>(); // refers to EMPLOYEE CLASS ABOVE
    
    // standard constructors/getters/setters   
}
```
