# Maps, Primitives, File I/O

Primitives, such as int, long, double, char and boolean and some other's not used as much yet is tied to a reference type, which apparently is the same thing but capitalized and worthy of a full name like Integer and Boolean. Objects have a single value of a primitive type. The difference in choosing how and when to use them seems to come down almost entirely to how much memory is available and how much the speed of the program will be affected by using or omitting objects which are still measured in bits, but significantly more bits than their primitive cousins.

It's almost 3AM, I'll come back to this...
