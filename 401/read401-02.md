# Arrays, Loops, Imports

Very similar, if not identical to their JavaScript counterparts, loops will continuously execute commands until their conditions to stop are met. The conditions themselves are Boolean expressions. The `for`, `for each`, `do`, `do-while` loops all make their triumphant return in Java.

To refresh that old ground, the for loop functions as long as it is within the parameters of it's counter, the good 'ol `let i = 0; etc.` remains in Java with the exception that let is no longer around, and we use `int i = 0; etc` instead. While loops will run for eternity if it's control statement is true.

Packages in Java are directories, and package names are the same as folder/directory names that contain the .java files. We can also bring in classes from other packages.
