# Notifications

provided docs are weird, use these?
https://docs.amplify.aws/sdk/push-notifications/getting-started/q/platform/android

Push notifications to make your app as annoying as possible, configured through amplify CLI `amplify add notifications` on the app folder and pick `FCM` for Firebase Cloud Messaging and enter API key (or ServerKey as FCM console refers to it)

Do the usual, dependencies to the `APP` build.gradle

```java
 dependencies {
     // Overrides an auth dependency to ensure correct behavior
     implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:15.0.1'

     implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:17.3.0'

     implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-pinpoint:2.15.+'
     implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.15.+@aar') { transitive = true }
 }

 apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

and this to the PROJECT build.gradle

```java
 buildscript {
     dependencies {
         classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.0.1'
     }
 }

 allprojects {
     repositories {
         google()
     }
 }
```
