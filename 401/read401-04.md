# OOP

## Object Oriented Programming Concepts

Java is an Object Oriented Programming language, so objects are right there in the name. Objects in the world of Software have *state* and *behavior* similar to physical objects. The state of the object is stored in a field and expresses itself through methods. The methods are the main way that objects communicate with each other. Data encapsulation is a principle of OOP, and is the process of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring interaction to be between methods like the dmz or the united nations.

Classes are instances of objects, and each class has the opportunity to be it's own unique object based on the code that goes into it.
