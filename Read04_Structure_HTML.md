### Process and Design

Preceeding any decisions regarding the appearance of a website it is good to have a clear understanding of Who you're building the site for and what you can offer them. In attracting someone to your website you are selling them on your concept, and in sales it is imperative that you understand your audience. Artistic direction of the site should follow the whims of your viewers. A beautiful and contemporary website with massive high-res pictures and small stylized font might be good for an upscale restaurant or a cocktail bar but if you're trying to sell an exhaust system for a motorcycle then that website might not appeal to your target demographic.

With your audience in mind you can construct a wireframe, which is a very basic blueprint of your website-to-be. Blocking areas for images and text and overall just getting a layout to reference when actually putting your code on the screen.

When it comes to the actual design of the website itself it's important to keep in mind that you're trying to tell a story that ultimately leads your audience somewhere. Whether it's to a checkout button, downloading your software or signing up for your email list you need to entice your audience with a page that's eye-catching, easy to navigate, and your communication is clear and consistent.
