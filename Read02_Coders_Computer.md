# Choosing a Text Editor 

##### The Basic Editors

Basic editors are the bare-bones programs that come installed on your computer. Notepad on Windows, Text Edit on Macs and Gedit or whatever comes with your flavor of Linux distro. Again, these are *basic* editors with very minimal if any features and little to no customization or extension support. They're there for you to plug in your code accurate to the letter since there's nothing to let you know if you didn't close a bracket somewhere or have a typo hidden in your code that breaks the entire website. On the plus side, if you could consider it one, such a Spartan editor *forces* you to write perfect code, and if you can't write it perfectly you're going to get pretty good at hunting for errors.

##### Third-Party Editors

These are editors developed, often for free, by developers looking to make their lives a little easier. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), all free to download and come with slick UIs and time saving features like Code Completion which serves as an invisible hand filling out that last little keystroke you missed on, Syntax Highlighting which highlights sections of your code making it far easier to dissect at a glance, visual aids to reduce eye-strain over long sessions, and the ability to add extensions which are additional user-created aids that layer on top of the editor to fit your needs specifically. These editors are the most flexible, and as the best editor is the one that works best for you, it's good to explore these options instead of suffering through a basic editor.

##### IDEs

An IDE or *Integrated Development Environment* takes the benefits of the third party editors mentioned above and adds even more features like a file manager, compiler and a debugger. When just starting out using an IDE could be a bit overwhelming, and it's a good idea to get used to one of the third-party editors like one listed above or one of the many available online
