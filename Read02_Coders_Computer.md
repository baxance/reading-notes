# Choosing a Text Editor 

###### The Basic Editors

Basic editors are the bare-bones programs that come installed on your computer. Notepad on Windows, Text Edit on Macs and Gedit or whatever comes with your flavor of Linux distro. Again, these are *basic* editors with very minimal if any features and little to no customization or extension support. They're there for you to plug in your code accurate to the letter since there's nothing to let you know if you didn't close a bracket somewhere or have a typo hidden in your code that breaks the entire website. On the plus side, if you could consider it one, such a Spartan editor *forces* you to write perfect code, and if you can't write it perfectly you're going to get pretty good at hunting for errors.
