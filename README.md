## Description
This is a collection of my readings for Codefellows 102 and 201.

### About Me
I'm Barrett and I think The Elder Scrolls III: **Morrowind** is still the best RPG ever made and that *Warhammer 40K* is better than Star Wars. I left the world of spirits as a production manager/head distiller to learn to code. If you're in the Seattle area you should try [the whiskey](https://www.tastings.com/Spirits-Review/Copperworks-Distilling-Company-American-Single-Malt-Whiskey-USA-96-Proof-11-01-2018.aspx) I used to help make. I'd be thrilled to talk with anyone about whiskey or gin, either learning about the process or favorite spirits or whatever.
