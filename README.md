### About Me
I'm Barrett and I think The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is still the best RPG ever made and that Warhammer 40K is better than Star Wars.

### Growth Mindset
 Growth Mindset is **self determination.** It is the conscious and ongoing decision to not be constrained by preconceptions of inherent ability or talent. To allow yourself setbacks or slow progress without the harsh judgement that would only impede your progress, and instead frame those things as necessary challenges intrinsic to a task worth doing or a subject worth learning.

#### Three Examples of Staying in a Growth Mindset
* As in all things discipline will trump motivation over the long term. Creating and staying consistent with your own schedule especially when it's uncomfortable or inconvenient to do so will help you remain in a state of mind that is focuses on progress.
* A gentle approach when confronted with frustration can save you from feeling something is impossible. When I encounter a problem I tend to have tunnel vision, and I'll look to break down the wall in front of me instead of taking a step back and looking for a door.
* Taking constructive criticism personally is the easy but harmful approach. Like drinking a tasty poison instead of some bitter medicine, it's choosing self satisfaction through degrees of denial and deflection instead of taking a difficult look inward to see if there really is merit to that criticism. Don't let your ego blind you to a chance for improvement!
