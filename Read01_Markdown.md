# Markdown

### Or how I learned to stop worrying and love flavor text

**Markdown** is a *lightweight* language used for simple webpage formatting on [GitHub](http://github.com). Markdown files have the extension ".markdown" or more succinctly ".md" which I can only assume also stands for "MarkDown"

You don't have to only use Markdown for changes in text, you can create lists as well be preceeding a line with a simple '- ' or a '* '

- Like
- This

Or number them by simply placing a number '1. ' before each line.
1. Which
1. Looks
1. like
1. this
   
But really, there's a lot of simple formatting you can do with very little effort that will make your page look so much better. Here's my tightly kept secret for the fancy bold and italics used at the start.
 
| Markdown Code | In Use |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Enclose text with * to Italicize | *italicize* | 
| Enclose text with ** to bold | **bold** |


The fancy table I put that secret info in? Assemble your table headers with a pipe '|' and a space between them and dashes '---' similarly separated by a pipe beneath them. Then organize the text below each header by placing another pipe between them.


Header Pipe here -> | Another Header
------ | ------
theres dashes above this | <-and another pipe there

I'll end this with my favorite cat picture. Use '![image text](image url here)' and copy paste the image URL (as long as you have permission of course) and you've got a way to plug in a picture.
