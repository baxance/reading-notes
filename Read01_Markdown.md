# Markdown

### Or how I learned to stop worrying and love flavor text

**Markdown** is a *lightweight* language used for simple webpage formatting on [GitHub](http://github.com). Markdown files have the extension ".markdown" or more succinctly ".md" which I can only assume also stands for "MarkDown"

You don't have to only use Markdown for changes in text, you can create lists as well

   But really, there's a lot of simple formatting you can do with very little effort that will make your page look so much better. Here's a cheat-sheet.
   
| Markdown Code | In Use |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| * xyz * without spaces to Italicize | *italicize* |
| ** abc ** without spaces to bold | **bold** |
