# Markdown

### Or how I learned to stop worrying and love flavor text

**Markdown** is a *lightweight* language used for simple webpage formatting on [GitHub](http://github.com). Markdown files have the extension ".markdown" or more succinctly ".md" which I can only assume stands for "MarkDown"

You don't have to only use Markdown for changes in text, you can create lists as well
