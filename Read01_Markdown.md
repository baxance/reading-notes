# Markdown

### Or how I learned to stop worrying and love flavor text

**Markdown** is a *lightweight* language used for simple webpage formatting on [GitHub](http://github.com). Markdown files have the extension ".markdown" or more succinctly ".md" which I can only assume also stands for "MarkDown"

You don't have to only use Markdown for changes in text, you can create lists as well be preceeding a line with a simple '- ' or a '* '

- Like
- This

Or number them by simply placing a number '1. ' before each line.
1. Which
1. Looks
1. like
1. this
   
But really, there's a lot of simple formatting you can do with very little effort that will make your page look so much better. Here's my tightly kept secret for the fancy bold and italics used at the start.
 
| Markdown Code | In Use |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Enclose text with * to Italicize | *italicize* | 
| Enclose text with ** to bold | **bold** |
