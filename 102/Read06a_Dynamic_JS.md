### Overview of JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) continues to build upon the content set up by HTML and the presentation put into place by CSS by adding a layer of behavior that can bring your website to life by giving visitors to your site new tools to interact with.

Like best practice from CSS, encouraging a separate file for your JS and linking it to your HTML, in this case using ```<script>``` tags, is an efficient way to build this last layer of your site. Keeping the files separate allows you to see all of your JS in one place and thus add or troubleshoot all in one place.

### Basic JS
JS uses a simple language that allows it to communicate effectively with HTML.
#### Objects and Methods
```document.write('Good Afternoon!');```

The above line of code, referred to as calling a method of an object, includes an *Object* demonstrated by "document". An Object is the piece of the website that will be altered with a *Method*, which in that sample includes everything proceeding the  ```.``` and determines what in this case will be written where the ```<script>``` tags lie.
#### Variables
Like their algebraic counterparts, JS *Variables* are flexible parts of the JS script that temporarily store information that is allowed to change. Things like the time of day can be constructed out of variables organized in such a way that no matter when you open the website once the code is submitted, the time displayed will always be correct because the variables are constantly keeping track of it. 

```var quantity```

```quantity = 3```

The above section of code is a simple variable. *var* stands for variable and declares your intent to use it. *quantity* is the given name for this variable, though you can name it what you like. In the second line you recall the name of the variable, and with the eqauals sign you assign the *quantity* variable a value of *3*

#### Rules for Naming Variable
1. The name must begin with a letter, $, or _
1. The name can contain the above and numbers, but no -, _, or.
1. You cannot use established JS keywords
1. Variables are case sensitive
1. Use a name relevant to the information it will store
1. Names can contain more than one word strung together unspaced, but keep the first word lower-case and begin every preceeding word upper-case.
