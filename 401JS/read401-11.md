# Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?

Can't keep people from doing stuff they're not supposed to if you can't close and lock the door, right?

2. Describe an application that would need access control.

enterprise management systems for example would need an admin or user with greater permissions to set schedules, tasks, etc. while users with less permissions would only be able to view those things, not perfrom CRUD

3. What is a role used for?

For assigning permissions to the users that role applies and is attached to.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

scalability and flexibility. assigning or granting roles and the permissions that come with them is easier than creating them specifically for every user you want to have them.
