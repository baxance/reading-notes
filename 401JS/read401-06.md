* Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
  
  It is a design pattern of the 23 "Gang of Four" pattern. It's usage facilitates problem solving by making it so that each class has one instance, that instance is easily accessible, you can control it's instantiation, restrict the number of instances and access a global variable.

* Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes

  Singletons can be used to create an instance of a class if it does not exist, else return the reference of the existing class. So singletons are created only ones during the runtime of an application.

* If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

  lol idk
