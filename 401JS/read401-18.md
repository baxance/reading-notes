# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

1. What are serverless functions?

A cloud-computing model wherein the cloud host allocates resources as needed to execute a function on demand, relieving the need for it to live permanently on a server.

2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

lol damn I really would not know sorry

3. Describe how a CDN works

Content Delivery Networks are a network of servers linked together to deliver content quickly. This sounds a lot like the internet. Anyway CDN servers are go-betweens for users and internet (there it is) providers. Those servers provide the ISPs access to each other's traffic which somehow makes things go faster.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Term | Definition
-----|-----------
Serverless Functions | Functions stored on a server, but it's far away so we can pretend it exists in the ether. These functions are executed on demand by a cloud service provider
Cloud Storage | A means of using physical drives very far away like above, that provide a user with the resources on demand. As above, this relieves a developer from the constraints of physical storage and scaling.
CDN | Content Delivery Network of proxy servers and databases that seemingly decentralizes data so it can reach users faster.
