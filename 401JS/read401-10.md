# Stacks and Queues

### Stacks

Stacks are exactly as they sound. A data structure mimicking a stack that only allows access to the Node at the `top` of the stack. You can only ever remove what is at the top of the stack, when adding things to the stack the newest item will always be at the top. This is encapsulated by LIFO, or Last-In-First-Out and FILO, or First-In-Last-Out.

Methods of a Stack | What They Do
-------------------|-------------
`push` | Adds a new node to the top of the stack
`pop` | removes the top Node from the stack
`peek` | returns the value of the top Node in the stack
`isEmpty` | returns Boolean value if the stack is empty or not

### Queues

I think in the UK this is what they call a line. So you're at the DMV and there are 5 people ahead of you. You are at the `rear` of the queue, right? They call a number over the PA and someone heaves a heavy sigh and goes to a booth. That person was at the `front` of the queue and have just been dequeued, so the person next after them is now the front right? It's a line. You get in and you get out in the order by which you entered.

Methods of a Queue | What They Do
-------------------|-------------
`Enqueue` | input value is added to and becomes the rear of the queue
`Dequeue` | the front of the queue is removed and the node behind it becomes the front
`peek` | returns the value of the front of the queue
`isEmpty` | returns boolean value if queue is empty or not
