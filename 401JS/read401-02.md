* What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

PUT modifies resources where the client sends data that updates the resource, replaces an old resource or creates one if none currently exists. High bandwidth
PATCH performs a partial update of resources, and does not replace, creating duplicates instead. Low bandwidth. [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-put-and-patch-request/)

* Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

status code | description
------------|------------
400 | Bad request. user id must be an integer and > 0
401 | authorization missing or invalid
404 | specified user id not found

* Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

REST is newer and faster in web application and the guidelines are more flexible and REST APIs are lightweight for mobile apps and serverless computing. SOAP offers built in security and transaction compliance, good for larger businesses.
