1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

Basic isn't very secure and should be used in conjunction with HTTS and other encryption methods. Bearer is like paying money for a beer token then exchanging that token with someone else. Bearer tokens are exchanging your credentials and then using that token for api calls

Allows fior token authentication

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

keep it secret, keep it safe
