# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

Their functionality is practically identical. Both perform CRUD, and create RESTful web applications

2. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

3. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

Is this a trick question? A "standard" queue obets the FIFO principle so I don't believe there is any difference

4. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

Listen for a status code or something being emit from the receiving end and emit a validation message of its own?

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Term | Definition
-----|-----------
Serverless API | API that lives on a server that isn't your own. It's gone off to the farm where it can run free and get as big as it wants and you don't have to mess around with hardware
Triggers | Something a lambda function listens to, and executes when it is heard. Also a great and super original name for a bad stand up comedy special
Dynamo vs Mongo | Mongo is more flexible in its deployment and allows for larger file storage. Mongo also isn't owned by Amazon which is a huge +
Dynamoose vs Mongoose | They both function as tools for making their respective databases easier to use, but again Mongoose isn't owned by Amazon so big ups there. Mongoose are also cute.
