# [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

Having bombed a few whiteboard/technical interviews now this article was the most relevant to me, so I'll be focusing on this. I had committed some of the errors that the author describes, namely starting to code immediately. It's something done out of nervousness and the desire to appear confident ande capable by just diving into the problem, but in my experience it makes you seem error-prone. The article provides 6 steps for problem solving:

* Read the problem completely *twice*

To ensure a thorough understanding of the problem presented and the solution expected

* Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data

While this may not seemingly progress you closer to the solution programmatically, it is an important step to establish a connection before jumping into the code unprepared. It's like giving time for a video to buffer. You may not be watching it *right now* but the short wait will allow a far smoother experience.

* Optimize the manual steps

An introduction of automation and logic to the previous solutions. In the example given, instead of looking at each letter of a string individually in a reverse order and adding it to a new string one by one here is where some code can be injected to make the process simpler and faster. Such as using a loop to examine the given data and rearrange it automatically.

* Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code

Just as code itself is a blueprint for a computer to accomplish a task, so is pseudo-code a blueprint for your construction of that code. It may seem redundant, but writing pseudo code, wherein you create instructions for yourself using the proper terminology and syntax but without the concern of what you're writing to be functional (yet)

* Replace the comments or Pseudo-Code with real code

Once the pseudo code is complete that opens the door to actually making it work. You've thoroughly understood the problem, achieved a basic understanding of how to solve the problem, picked the programming tools you'll need to enact the solution. At this point you follow your own instructions and assemble your code.

* Optimize the real code

Often the reaction from the interviewer (at least in my experience) is "okay that works. Is there a way to make this more efficient?" Which is your cue to panic, forget all of these steps and try and shove a different solution into the middle of the solution you already have instead of creating an entirely new solution.
