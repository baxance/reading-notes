# Introductory HTML & JS

## HTML
### Structure

HTML Provides the basic outline, or skeletal *structure* of a webpage. The basic content layed out in the order that you want it. This skeleton is built of **elements** composed of **tags** and **characters**. A **tag** is a set of angled brackets "`< >`" with a character(s) nested within them "`<p>`". "`<p>`" is a complete **element** with a character between tags, but that **element** must eventually be ended, and thus you mirror the element with the addition of a backslash "`</p>`". 

You can alter the behavior of a tag by attaching an **attribute** to the opening tag. `<p lang="arabic">النشوة وتمجيد الألم نشأت بالفعل، وسأعرض لك\</p>` in this example the **attribute name** "`lang`" proceeds the `p` character and defines the attribute. Following the **attribute name** with an equals before it and enclosed in quotes is the **attribute value** which defines the behavior of the attribute. In the case of the code above the `lang` indicates that the language of the element will be defined by the value of the attribue "`="arabic">`.

Other **Attributes** are ***ID*** and ***Class*** and both function as markers for later configuration in CSS. `<p id="quote">` the `id` attribute here can only be used once per page, and when characteristics are applied through CSS those characteristics affect everything with the ID. Similar rules apply for the `class` attribute `<p class="quote">` except it can be used multiple times with differing CSS rules applying to them each time it's named differently.


With different versions of HTML available a we want to be certain the browser will read our code as ***HTML5***. `<!DOCTYPE html>` Should be the first line of code written to ensure this.

Element | Purpose | Tags
--------|---------|-------
Block Elements | These are elements that will start on a new line in the browser | `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, <l1>`
Inline Elements | Elements that will remain on the same line it is included in | `<a>, <b>, <em>, <img>`
Block Grouping | Tag that groups a body of elements together for later configuration as a whole in CSS | `<div>`
Inline Grouping | Used to differentiate a section of text where you don't want a line to break | `<span>`
IFrame | Creates a window with your specified dimensions to insert another website (weather, map) | `<iframe>, <src>, <height>, <width>, <scrolling>, <frameborder>, <seamless>`
Headers & Footers | Creates Headers & Footers | `<header>, <footer>`
Navigation | Organizes navigational blocks/lists | `<nav>`
Articles | Frames sections of text that could stand alone | `<article>`
Asides | When used inside an article contains relevant information to specific article | `<aside>`
Sections | Groups related content together within it, including  *Articles* | `<section>`
Heading groups | Groups headers 1-6 | `<hgroup>`
Figures and Captions | Contains content referenced from the main body | `<figure>, <figcaption>`
Sectioning Elements | Groups related elements together when there are no better options | `<div>`

## JavaScript Intro

Java**Script** is instructions that the computer follows in a linear fashion to accomplish a goal. The directions themselves must be deliberate and precise, even though the browser may not use every line of code when the page is run. **JavaScript** is the final layer on top of HTML which provides a foundation and content, CSS that presents that content in a more aesthetic way. The JavaScript provides functionality and interactivity to the page.

### Calling a method of an object

`document.write('hello');`

In the sample code above, `document` represents the *object*. the `.` is the *member operator*. The *object* "document" has several members that will alter it's behavior. The *member operator* `.` grants access to that *objects* **members**. `write();`is a method of the *document* that allows content within the parentheses to be delivered to the page where the `<script>` element is placed. Within the parenthese and also within quotes is the *parameters*. This *method* `write` would not function if there were no parameters to `write` to the page. In this example `'hello'` is the *parameter* of the *method*.
