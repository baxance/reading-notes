# HTML Images, CSS Color and Text

## IMAGES

You'd be hard to pressed in this modern age to find a website that does not include an image in some manner. As social media's obsession with memes has proved, an image can quickly capture a user's attention and convey information, but this is nothing new. A picture is worth a thousand words. Inserting an image into your HTML code is a simple enough task, often requiring little more than knowing (or copying) the URL of the image you would like to insert. This can be tricky though, as nearly all images are subject to copyright, and copyright law is a real beast. There are *stock images* you can use that are royalty free, though they often are overlayed with a watermark of the company that owns and distributes them.

You can link images directly from the internet, but that can become messy. It is a simple enough task to create a folder within the directory that also contains your HTML, CSS, etc. A simple "images" folder that you can store images within. This will help you with planning out your website too, as you can collect all the images you'll need beforehand and have them stored internally instead of having to track down URLs.

```html
<img src="ImageURL.com" alt="alt text to be displayed or read to the user if the image is unable to be displayed or seen" title="additional info displayed to the user when image is hovered over" />
```

The above example is the typical format of inserting an image from the internet into your code.

```html
<img src="images/cat.jpg" width="500" height="500" />
```

This example demonstrates both the internal pathing to pull an image from the folder you would ostensibly create for your own images. Also demonstrated are the `height` and `width` elements which as you could guess, control the height and width of the image when the website loads.

The `<img src=...>` tag as demonstrated does not need a closing `</img>` tag and instead the element simply ends with `/>`.

You can place the box of the image element within the box of another element. Taking `<p>` paragraphs for example...

- Inserting the image tag *before* the paragraph will insert the image in a block above the text block

- Within the paragraph, just after the opening `<p>` tag, will have the image in line with the first line of text, and the text then wrapping around the image

- You can place the image in the middle of your parahraph content, but this will create significant margin between your lines of text

You can also throw a cool `align="left/right/top/middle/bottom"` attribute within your `<img ...  />` element to align the image either left or right of the text block, making it look neat and orderly. Top, middle and bottom can create significant margin between lines of text or create a wrapping effect.

When selecting images from the internet to save to your folder be careful to save them with the most efficient format. JPEG images are better for those with rich and varied color, while GIF (pronounced like the peanut butter not the actress) and PNG are better for images with very simple color schemes.

## Color in CSS

There are three primary colors expressed by a pixel: RGB or Red, Green and Blue. These three primary colors are mixed together, like watercolors in kindergarten, to create different colors. There are 3 primary methods to pick the color you want for your string of CSS.

- RGB Values expressed with three values between 0-255 each respectively representing Red, Green and Blue. `rgb(102, 205, 170)`
- Hex Codes use a hexadecimal code like `#66cdaa` with each pair of characters representing RGB
- Names are the simplest method picking a color, as you can simply type what color you want. This does not offer great flexibility and outside of primary colors it doesn't make much sense to memorize all 147 color names.

```CSS
p {
  color: Red;
  background-color: #ee3e80;
}
h1 {
  color: rgb:(100, 200, 17)
}
```

In the examples above are the three methods of picking a color, and the methods of choosing your foreground (text) color `color:` and background color which should be self evident.

Other color modifiers | Use
----|----
`opacity : ;` | Controls the opacity through a 0.0->1.0 value representing 0%->100% respectively
`rgba: ;` | allows you to change the color of a child element, and allow the overlapping boxes to mesh
`...: hsl(30,15%,2%);` | HSL for Hue, Saturation and Lightness allow a new method of specifying color
`...: hsla(30,15%,2%,0.7);` | the `A` at the end of this hsl property (Alpha) controls the opacity with the same method as the `opacity` modifier

## Text

Typeface | Description | Font example
----|----|---
Serif | extra detail on the primary strokes of letters | Georgia, Times, Times New Roman
Sans-Serif | low-res and with straight strokes | Arial, Verdana, Helvetica
Monosapce | Each letter has the same width | Courier, Courier New
Cursive | Joining strokes or other stylistic similarities to cursive | Comic Sans MS(the GOAT), Monotype Corsiva
Fantasy | Decorative, not designed to be read for long | Impact, Haettenschweiler
Weight | Light, medium, bold, black
Style | normal, italic, oblique
Stretch | condensed, reguilar, extended

To specify your desired typeface in CSS...

```CSS
p {
  font-family: Arial, Times, Comic;
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

Specifying a list of fonts in this manner acts as a failsafe. Meaning if the browser loading the page does not possess the first font it will use the next in line and so forth. `font size` is self explanatory, and can be changed by determining pixel size (`12px;`), Percentages (`127%;`), or EMS (`1,3em;`) in which a single "EM" is the letter 'm' and scales text from there.

Other Formatting CSS | Description
--|--
`font-weight: bold` | Bold text
`font-style: italic/oblique` | Italic/Oblique text
`text-transform: uppercase/lowercase/capitalize` | Forces text to upper or lowercase, or automatically makes the first word in every letter capitalized
`text-decoration: underline/overline/line-through/blink/none` | Creates lines under, over or through the text. If you want to be annoying you can make your text flash with `blink` and `none` removes any already applied decoration
`line-height: 1.4em` | alters space between lines of text
`letter-spacing: 0.2em` | alters space between words
`text-align: left/right/center/justify` | Alters the alignment of text Left/Right/Center. Justify makes every line in a body of text save the last take up the full with of it's box
`vertical-align: text-top/baseline/text-bottom` | Used in conjunction with image elements to position the text relative to the image box
`text-indent: 10px` | The first line of text will be indented by the specified value
`text-shadow: 1px -2px 3px #000000` | creates a shadow on the text, positioned with the three pixel amounts and colored with a method of your choosing
PSEUDO-ELEMENTS | DECRIPTION
`p.intro:first-letter { font-size: 200%}`| Makes the first letter in a block of text the specified size
`p.intro:first-line {font-size: 120%}` | Makes the first line in a block of text the specified size
`a.link {color: black}` | makes a clickable link the specifies color
`a.visited {color: red}` | Automatically makes a visited link turn the specified color
`input.submit.hover {background-color: red}` | Specified color is applied when user hovers over the element
`input.submit.active{background-color: green}` | Specified color is applied when the user "activates" an element like a button
`input.submit.focus{color: blue}` | Applies specified color to an element you want to draw focus to like an interactable element you don't want the user to miss
