# Problem Domain, Objects and the DOM

## The Problem Domain

The hardest part of programming to learn?! But what is it? The article never really says, but the first result on google from Definitions.com gives us this:
>A problem domain is the area of expertise or application that needs to be examined to solve a problem. A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else.

Basically, the Problem Domain can be a hindrance when trying to learn something new like coding because the student if given a project with too much focus on the Problem Domain will focus on what the project is for. Focusing on the practicality of what they are building instead of focusing on what they need to learn in order *to* build it. But if you can supply yourself with a clear understanding of the problem domain of the task you have to handle then it can make the task much easier because of the lack of ambiguity. The article comes to the conclusion, it seems to me, that by giving people clear instructions it makes performing their job easier.
