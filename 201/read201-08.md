# Layouts Again

## Recap!

- CSS Treats every HTML Element as it's own block-level or inline box
  - Block-Level elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>` start on a new line
  - Inline elements like `<img>`, `<b>`, `<i>` flow between the surrounding text
- Block level elements can nest inside one another, and the containing element is known as a... containing element or parent element

- Element Positioning
  - Normal flow is what most elements default to with one following the next on a new line
    - `position: static;`
  - Relative positioning moves an element to the top, bottom, left, right of where it would have otherwise been
    - `position: relative;`
  - Absolute positioning positions the element in relation to its containing element and is taken out of normal flow
    - `position: absolute;`
  - Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window rather than the containing element
    - `position: fixed;`
  - Floating elements take the element out of normal flow and position it either far left or right of it's containing box
    - `float: right/left;`
    - Clearing a float states that elements shouldn't touch the specified side of the box
      - `clear: left/right/both;`

Fixed Width Layouts designs don't change their size as the browser window changes size. This gives the designer more creative control at the risk of the website not working on some screens or devices because images that would be a respectable size on a desktop browser would be huge on a phone. This comes down to understanding your audience to decide how your wesbite should look and for who. Liquid layouts on the other hand stretch and contract with the size of the window making it a far more flexible design choice for websites that would be used frequently on mobile devices as the website would contort itself to fit the phone screen so the only has to scroll up and down. On the downside it can be hard to maintain your design choices over different devices.
