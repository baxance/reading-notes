# Layouts Again

## Recap!

- CSS Treats every HTML Element as it's own block-level or inline box
  - Block-Level elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>` start on a new line
  - Inline elements like `<img>`, `<b>`, `<i>` flow between the surrounding text
- Block level elements can nest inside one another, and the containing element is known as a... containing element or parent element

- Element Positioning
  - Normal flow is what most elements default to with one following the next on a new line
    - `position: static;`
  - Relative positioning moves an element to the top, bottom, left, right of where it would have otherwise been
    - `position: relative;`
  - Absolute positioning positions the element in relation to its containing element and is taken out of normal flow
    - `position: absolute;`
  - Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window rather than the containing element
    - `position: fixed;`
  - Floating elements take the element out of normal flow and position it either far left or right of it's containing box
    - `float: right/left;`
    - Clearing a float states that elements shouldn't touch the specified side of the box
      - `clear: left/right/both;`
